<p1><i><center>The Tesla Model 3 perfomance is mix of sport and drag racing mixed with an immersive luxury experience. This statement has been approved by many car and tech reviewers such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AutoFocus">Autofocus by MKBHD (Marques Brownlee)</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AutoTraderTV">Autotrader</a></p1></i></center>
<h2><i><u><center>Suggestions about the vehicle</center></u></i></h2>
<p2><i>This year the Tesla Model 3 performance has had many upgrades even causing some people to say that this extreme performance car could be used as a daily commuter car and not just a car for a weekend race. Others even agreeing that this may be the electric car for car enthusiasts!. People speculated others may be suggesting this due to its new specs. </i></p2>
<h3><i><u><center>Specification of the 2024 Tesla Model 3 performance</center></u></i></h3>
<p3><i>The specification of the Model 3 performance is in a way the same as the previous in my opinion but it is a bit obvious as the 0-60 mph is 2.9 seconds and the previous generation has a 0-60 mph of 3.1 secs its different but you can not feel the difference. Although the positives about it are that you have a new suspension and seats.</i></p3>
